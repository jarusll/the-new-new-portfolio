## What is a permutation?

**What is the permutation of `{ }`?**

`{ }`

**What is the permutation of `{1}`?**

`{1}`

**What is the permutation of `{1, 2}`?**

- `{1, 2}`
- `{2, 1}`

**What is the permutation of `{1, 2, 3}`?**

- `{1, 2, 3}`
- `{1, 3, 2}`
- `{2, 1, 3}`
- `{2, 3, 1}`
- `{3, 1, 2}`
- `{3, 2, 1}`

**Which of them start with `1`?**

- `{1, 2, 3}`
- `{1, 3, 2}`

**What are the rest of these elements?**

- `{2, 3}`
- `{3, 2}`

**Do they resemble something?**

- No

**What about the permutation of `{2, 3}`?**

- Yes

**What is `append x` on `{y, z}`?**

<ul>
    <li>{`{x, y, z}`}</li>
</ul>

**What is `append x` on each of `{y, z}`?**

- `{x, y}`
- `{x, z}`

**Can we say the permutation of `{1, 2, 3}` = `{append 1 on each permutation of {2, 3}}, {append 2 on each permutation of {1, 3}}, {append 3 on each permutation of {1, 2}}`?**

- That's a mouthful.

**What is `{append 1 on each permutation of {2, 3}}`?**

- `{append 1 on each permutation of {2, 3}}`
- `{append 1 on each {{2, 3}, {3, 2}}}`
- `{{1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}}`

**What about `{append 2 on each permutation of {1, 3}}` and `{append 3 on each permutation of {1, 2}}`?**

- `{{2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}}`

**What do we get when we combine them all?**

- `{{1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {3, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 1}}`
- i.e., `permutation of {1, 2, 3}`

**Do you know what a permutation is now?**

- Yes

**Did you have fun?**

- Go have some cookies.
