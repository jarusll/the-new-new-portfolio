# My list of Emacs packages #

## magit ##
The best git interface I've ever used. I cannot imagine using anything else but this for git.

## which-key #
Shows completion keybinds for incomplete keys. Gets you familiar with modes.

## ivy + ivy-rich ##
Completion engine for emacs. Comes with rich observability features like
  * Entities(command, function, variable...) docstring
  * Keybind of commands

and much more features to make using the minibuffer easy.

## golden-ratio ##
Automatically expands the window you switch to. Very big, split like crazy and stop caring.

## helpful ##
A better \*help\* buffer. Just because its better.

## keycast ##
A nice to have utility to see which commands are being executed.

There are other modes as well which I use, I only included utility packages here. You can check out my .emacs config [here](https://github.com/jarusll/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs ".emacs config ")
