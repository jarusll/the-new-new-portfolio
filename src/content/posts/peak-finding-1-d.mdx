# 1D Peak finding

**What is a 1D peak?**

An element in a 1D array which is greater than its neighbour

**Which element has the least number of neighbours?**

A one without any, Singleton

**Is `7` a peak in `[7]`?** -- `Base case 1`**

Yes, an uncontested victory.

**Whats the peak in `[7, 8]`? -- `Base case 2`**

`8`, max(array) if array has only 2 elements

**What the next element which has the least number of neighbours?**

Edges, since they have only 1 neighbour

**Is `7` a peak in `[7, 3, ...]`? -- `Base case left edge`**

Yes, since `7 > 3`

**Is `7` a peak in `[..., 3, 7]`? -- `Base case right edge`**

Yes

**Is `7` a peak in `[..., 3, 7, 4, ...]`? -- `Base case mid`**

Yes, `7 > 3` and `7 > 4`

**Whats the peak in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, a strictly increasing array?**

5

**Whats the peak in `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, a strictly decreasing array?**

5

**Whats the peak in `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, a strictly leveled array?**

5

**Is `7` a peak in `[..., 3, 7, 9, ...]`?**

No, since `9 > 7`

**Where should we look for a peak next?**

`[9, ...]`, since it has atleast 1 peak

Reason, for the array `[9, x, ...]`
- Considering `x is less than 9`, in this case `9` is a peak
- Considering `x is equal to 9`, in this case `9` is a peak
- Considering `x is greater than 9`, then the slice `[x, ...]` contains the peak element -- `Case right`

**Whats the peak in `[]`? -- `Base Case 0`**

None

**How about finding all the peaks?**

Can be done using the same code and complete search

```
peak([...])
	[] => None -- Base case 0
	[x] => x -- Base case 1
	[a, b, ...] and a >= b => a -- Base case start
	[..., y, z] and y <= z => z -- Base case end
	[..., k, l, m, ...] and k <= l and l >= m => l -- Base case mid
	[..., k, l, m, ...] and k >= l => peak([..., k]) -- case left
	[..., k, l, m, ...] and l <= m => peak([m, ...]) -- case right
```
