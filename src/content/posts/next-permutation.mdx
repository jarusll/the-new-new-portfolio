## Next Permutation

**Do you know what a permutation is?**

Yes

**Can you tell the next lexicographic permutation for `{2, 1, 3}`?**

-   No

**What is the permutation of `{1, 2, 3}`?**

-   `{1, 2, 3}`
-   `{1, 3, 2}`
-   `{2, 1, 3}`
-   `{2, 3, 1}`
-   `{3, 1, 2}`
-   `{3, 2, 1}`

**What are the bounds of the above permutations?**

From `{1, 2, 3}`,strictly increasing to `{3, 2, 1}`,strictly decreasing.

**Can we say that a strictly decreasing arrangement has run out of its permutation?**

Yes

**What is the direction of making a permutation?**

From left to right

**Whats the direction of backtracking a permutation?**

From right to left

**Whats a strictly decreasing arrangement in `{1, 3, 2}` from end?**

-   `{3, 2}`

**Whats a strictly decreasing arrangement in `{2, 1, 3}` from end?**

-   `{3}`

    | Arrangement | Vacant |
    |-------------|--------|
    | `{2, 1}`    | `{3}`  |

**Have we run out of arrangements for `1`?**

Yes

**What should replace `1`?**

The next successor in the vacant pool

    | Arrangement | Vacant |
    |-------------|--------|
    | `{2, 3}`    | `{1}`  |

**What should the next step be?**

Appending sorted Vacant to the Arrangement because every new permutation starts sorted

    | Arrangement | Vacant |
    |-------------|--------|
    | `{2, 3, 1}` | `{}`   |

**Is `{2, 3, 1}` the next permutation after `{2, 1, 3}`?**

Yes

**Heres another, `{4, 6, 2, 3, 8, 5, 1}`**

    | Arrangement             | Vacant |
    |-------------------------|--------|
    | `{4, 6, 2, 3, 8, 5, 1}` | `{}`   |

**Determining the strictly decreasing arrangement from end**

    | Arrangement               | Vacant |
    |---------------------------|--------|
    | `{4, 6, 2, 3, *8, 5, 1*}` | `{}`   |

**Moving the strictly decreasing to Vacant space**

    | Arrangement    | Vacant      |
    |----------------|-------------|
    | `{4, 6, 2, 3}` | `{8, 5, 1}` |

**`3` has run out of its arrangements, its successor in Vacant space is `5`. Replacing `3` with `5`**

    | Arrangement    | Vacant      |
    |----------------|-------------|
    | `{4, 6, 2, 5}` | `{8, 3, 1}` |

**Sorting Vacant space and appending to Arrangement**

    | Arrangement             | Vacant |
    |-------------------------|--------|
    | `{4, 6, 2, 5, 1, 3, 8}` | `{}`   |
