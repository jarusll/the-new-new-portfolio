# Redux Primer

**What do you start with?**

## Actions

**What are `Actions`?**

-   User interactable actions
-   Events in the application logic

**What does an action look like?**

Its a javascript object

```json
{
	"type": String,
	"payload": JSONValue
}
```

The `type` is a string constant typically representing an action name. The `payload` is the data associated with the action event

Eg

```json
{
	"type": "ADD_POST",
	"payload": {
		"tags": ["primer"],
		"text": "What do you start with?..."
	}
}
```

**Would it be convenient if we had helper functions to create the action objects?**

Yes, they are called action creators


```javascript
function addPost({tags, text}){
	return {
		type: "ADD_POST",
		payload: {
			tags,
			text
		}
	}
}
```

**Can we do better?**

Yes, `createAction`, thanks `@reduxjs/toolkit`


```javascript
const { createAction } = require('@reduxjs/toolkit')

addPost = createAction('ADD_POST')

addPost({tags: ["primer"], text: "What do you start with?..."})
	{
		type: 'ADD_POST',
		payload: {
			tags: [ 'primer' ],
			text: 'What do you start with?...'
		}
	}
```

**Whats the next step?**

## Reducers

**What are reducers?**

Reducers manage your state using `prevstate` and `action` to give you `nextstate`

`PrevState + Action => NextState`

**What do they look like?**

Here's a trivial example of a reducer


```javascript
let initialState = 0
function counterReducer(state = initialState, action){
	switch(action.type){
		case "INCREMENT":
			return state + 1
		case "DECREMENT":
			return state - 1
		default:
			return state
	}
}

counterReducer(10, {type: "INCREMENT"})
```

**Can we do better?**

Yes, `createReducer`, thanks again `@reduxjs/toolkit`


```javascript
const { createReducer } = require('@reduxjs/toolkit')

let increment = createAction('counter/increment')
let decrement = createAction('counter/decrement')

initialState = 0
counterReducer = createReducer(initialState, (builder) => {
	builder
	.addCase(increment, (state, action) => state + 1)
	.addCase(decrement, (state, action) => state - 1)
})

counterReducer(10, increment())
```

    11


**Can we couple counter actions &amp; counter reducer for convenience?**

Yes, its called a `slice`

**Why is it called slice?**

Because they are a slice of the global state


```javascript
const { createSlice } = require('@reduxjs/toolkit')

initialState = 0
const counterSlice = createSlice({
	name: 'counter',
	initialState,
	reducers: {
		increment: (state) => state + 1,
		decrement: (state) => state - 1
	},
})

increment = counterSlice.actions.increment
counterReducer = counterSlice.reducer
counterReducer(10, counterSlice.actions.increment())

```

    11

*From this point on, `reducers` and `slices` may be used interchangeably*

**How to decide what reducers to make?**

Every reducer in the store(global state) is associated with a key

Eg - The value returned by `counterReducer` will be associated with key `count` in global state.

```json
{
	"count": counterReducer
}
```

So one good way to figure out the reducers is by determining the states you will access.

**Whats the next part?**

## Store

**Whats a store?**

The store is the global state

**How do you make a store?**

```javascript
const { configureStore } = require('@reduxjs/toolkit')
const store = configureStore({
	reducer: {
		count: counterSlice.reducer
	}
})
```

**How do you change state?**

By dispatching actions

```javascript
store.dispatch(increment())

{ type: 'counter/increment', payload: undefined }
```


**How do you access the state?**

```javascript
store.getState()

{ count: 1 }
```

**Has `redux` come a long way?**

Yes, thanks `@reduxjs/toolkit`
