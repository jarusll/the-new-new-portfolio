Hello friend, I know I said I wouldn't come here, but I like the comfort of an old friend. I come here to reflect and introspect.

2025 was the becoming of Suraj. I love that I tried alot of things. Be it 2d art or 3d modeling/sculpting or competitive programming. I HAVE to keep trying new things, keep doing things, keep building things. Thats how I grow.

I had issues trying to make sense of things. I had to hit my head against the wall, alot. Things started to make sense when I asked myself that there has to be a reason why I am struggling? I was more animal than human.

I am glad for the friendships I made, the company I keep and the people I look up to. I know whats important now. Thank you.

Hello friend, thanks for being here. I probably won't be coming here. You've served your purpose and I think its time to say goodbye, the happy kind.

My GPU died again. Fortunately it was under warranty so they should take care of it.

I really like Qt Designer, integrates cpp better than QML. I had issues interfacing cpp with QML. I need to figure out how to make qt daemons.

I am really liking Niagara launcher. So simple and intuitive.

Someone said this recently that `You cannot really tell about things in present. You can only say how things are when you look back` and I've been thinking about it.

I am watching `Swades` and I can't really stop myself from tearing up. I can't explain why. Maybe its because I've been out of touch with my culture. Maybe its because I haven't been close with my family.

Playing `The Talos Principle` I do believe we are an iteration. And that I need to preserve what I learn.

I am falling in love with forums. It's just cute what the AI just links up 10 years old solution to my problem. It makes me want to open up more, just shoot out the problem that I am having.

My GPU died again. Fortunately it was under warranty so they did replace it. But if anything happens again, I will be fucked.

I realized that even putting out unfinished work is okay. I have alot of unfinished notes and I always held them back till they felt finished.
I have alot of dialogues with myself where I try to simplify things so I can understand and now I can make them public as soon as I start one.

I have [lived](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=1441-3VoSo0&feature=shared) more in the past 1 year than I have in my 25 years of living.

Recently I had it with vscode on Windows. a simple line switch took about 1 second. I dropped everything and spent half of the day switching to nvim.
Windows is pleasant to use with the following utils for me
- Powertoys
- Altdrag
- Winget(I LOVE WINGET)
- Windows terminal with bash

- ShareX(because I love Async communication)

I was very surprised when a school friend reached out to me for their wedding invitation. It surprised me because I
drifted apart from my school friends as soon as I got out. Same with college. It was very nice talking to them without any awkwardness.

Cloudflare's flat pricing for domains is pretty cool.

[This](https://youtu.be/RONAjJYB5bE?feature=shared) is a very special video for me. I watch it everytime I am high and It makes me feel like my blood cells are vibrating.
