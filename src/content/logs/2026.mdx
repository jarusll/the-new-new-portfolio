Hello friend, language has made my life vivid. I can read more, I can understand more, I can taste things.
I can finally see myself. This feels no different from when I figured out recursion through self referenciality. I should know more when I read `Godel, Escher and Bach`.

I played Journey and it was beautiful. *SPOILER WARNING* The end screen really hits you with folks who came across you on the journey.

Hello friend, You'd be glad to hear that I've been building [Tokri](https://github.com/jarusll/tokri/). It all started when I installed a dock gnome extension and I tried to drag text content to save. Turns out there is no such thing available for linux. I looked at [Dropover](https://dropoverapp.com/) and I loved the mouse shake activation. I knew I wanted that for windows and linux because I use both. So I went ahead and built one. And then I built it for macOS as well(it wasn't hard).

I bought a mac mini m4(16/256) and I am in love with this thing. Not the OS but the hardware, its so small and cute and it even comes with a speaker omg. If I had to have 1 machine, It'd be the mac mini. No I din't get the keeb and trackpad, I have a kb/trackpad combo.

I have been writing as well. I am reading `On Writing Well` by `William Zinsser` and I am going to write, alot. I have a backlog of topics that I need clarity on in my tick tick list.
