I really should have some cat treats on me for my Mumbai kitties.

I like how lisp and smalltalk allow you to resolve errors by dropping you into the debugger.

Everything is memory and Memory is the architecture, thank you John von Neumann.

Feels like I am living the same day, over and over. And the only difference are my actions.

I did hello world of bootloader. I need to grok x86 assembly, `PC Assembly Language` by `Paul A. Carter` should help.

Everything about OS led me to The IBM PC BIOS Technical Reference.

I am reading Pronouns.

I figured out verbals. I've Adjectives & Adverbs for tomorrow.

I looked at how I can debug assembly better in gdb. I don't like how I have to use offsets from base pointer for arguments/locals on the stack, but I don't think it can get any simpler than this.
I figured it out, its part of calling convention.

I had a hard time understanding that things can just be.

I cycled to the beach.

I lost my reading list on my tablet which died. I had it stored in an emacs sheet.
To make reading easier, I set up calibre server on the mac mini.

As a kid, I had a one-dimensional view of good and bad. As soon as other layers came in, my decision making fell apart. I could not align my decisions with my north star - because I did not have one.

I went cycling on the foldie.

Hello, my current goal is to setup an execution environment in x86 real mode and play around in the bios. Its very liberating being this low level and that you can make your own abstractions.

Hello friend, I read `On Writing Well`. It taught me how to organize things. I am following this up with `The Deluxe Transitive Vampire`. It teaches you the syntax of english by examples, which I've grown very fond of since `The Little Schemer`.

I was thinking about building an OS, a playground where I can test my ideas. I read some of `Programming from the ground up` for x86 assembly and I feel comfortable enough to write trivial assembly with functions.

Hello friend, language has made my life vivid. I can read more, I can understand more, I can taste things.
I can finally see myself. This feels no different from when I figured out recursion through self referenciality. I should know more when I read `Godel, Escher and Bach`.

I played Journey and it was beautiful. *SPOILER WARNING* The end screen really hits you with folks who came across you on the journey.

Hello friend, You'd be glad to hear that I've been building [Tokri](https://github.com/jarusll/tokri/). It all started when I installed a dock gnome extension and I tried to drag text content to save. Turns out there is no such thing available for linux. I looked at [Dropover](https://dropoverapp.com/) and I loved the mouse shake activation. I knew I wanted that for windows and linux because I use both. So I went ahead and built one. And then I built it for macOS as well(it wasn't hard).

I bought a mac mini m4(16/256) and I am in love with this thing. Not the OS but the hardware, its so small and cute and it even comes with a speaker omg. If I had to have 1 machine, It'd be the mac mini. No I din't get the keeb and trackpad, I have a kb/trackpad combo.

I have been writing as well. I am reading `On Writing Well` by `William Zinsser` and I am going to write, alot. I have a backlog of topics that I need clarity on in my tick tick list.
